            ... but they will be at first. In any skill, hobby, or profession,
            developing good technique takes knowledge and practise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have learned some things about them, though,
            <em>responsive layouts</em> are actually quite pleasant to make
            (and, of course, to use).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, HTML5 and CSS have matured into very capable
            languages for creating and styling web interfaces. You should
            (hopefully) feel at the end of this course the ability to create (at
            least approximately) any web layout you like using these languages.

            Sadly, the button above can't help you. Inspecting the source code
            of this document, however, can.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have tried to summarize what we have learned (and some things we
            haven't) about HTML and CSS best practises into the design and
            documentation of this page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspect the elements, read the source code comments, and feel free
            to re-use this code in your future projects. Let me know if you have
            any questions!

          <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
          <p class="hover-expand">
            Mobile layouts are typically <em>single-column</em>, perfectly
            suited to the block stacking nature of <em>unstyled HTML</em>.
            Mobile-first designs force the developer to emphasize coherent
            structure and markup.

          <h2>Responsive</h2>
          <p class="hover-expand">
            Responsive web designs have
            <em>well-defined layouts for each device</em> used to browse the
            page. Tablet and Destkop layouts are often composed of many columns
            to take advantage of wider viewport space.

            in your browser's developer tools to inspect this page at a variety
            of widths. How does the overall layout change at each breakpoint?
            How are the styles of some components changed?

            With practise, you will obtain <em>genuine fluency</em> in
            expressing aesthetic and responsive interfaces using the modern
            tools of the trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that when you are developing websites, or any programs,
            <em>you are not the only person who uses them.</em> In fact, if you
            are successful in this field, your code and your projects will be
            used and read by others many

              Many websites have common requirements for how content should be
              displayed. Learning design
              <a href="https://web.dev/patterns/layout/">patterns</a> can help
              create and modify website layouts systematically.

          <p>
            While the content of your websites and your projects is of course
            important, the accessibility of your website is the key factor that
            determines whether that content can be used and understood by
            others. Therefore, it is important to understand the main obstactles
            to accessibility in user interface design.

            <h2>Break it down</h2>
            <p class="hover-expand">
              Not unlike lego, HTML structural elements are <em>blocks</em> by
              default. Each element is a unit on its own that, when combined
              with other elements, comprises a greater whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              When designing, ask yourself: what IS each element on my page?
              What are its constraints? How does it relate to the elements
              around it?

            <h2>Work your way up</h2>
            <p class="hover-expand">
              Not unlike cooking, CSS styles are <em>recipes</em> for combining
              and transforming ingredients into a finished <s>meal</s> website.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <s>cooking</s> adding css, ask yourself: does this style help
              fulfill a requirement of my project? Try to avoid band-aid
              solutions.

            <h2>~*~</h2>
            <p class="hover-expand">
              Not unlike any other programming language, it's helpful to debug
              as you develop. Temporary <em>borders</em> around elements in your
              CSS is one way to help visualize how that element is flowing in
              your document.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally: there's no need to be so serious all the time. It's okay
              to make mistakes. The important things it to just make stuff so
              that you can learn how it works.

              The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less you go to the
              theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think,
              love, theorise, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save
              &mdash; the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor
              rust will devour &mdash; your capital. The less you are, the less
              you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is
              your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged
              being. Everything taken from you in life and in humanity, is
              replaced for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which
              you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and, drink, go to the

              learning, the treasures of the past, political power &mdash; all

              need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be
              submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to
              want to live, and may only want to live in order to have that.
