            But they will be at first. In any skill, hobby, or profession,
            developing good technique takes knowledge and practise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have learned some things about them, though,
            <em>responsive layouts</em> are actually quite pleasant to make
            (and, of course, to use).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, HTML5 and CSS have matured into very capable
            languages for creating and styling web interfaces. You should
            (hopefully) feel at the end of this course the ability to create (at
            least approximately) any web layout you like using these languages.
          </p>
          <button type="" class="btn">I Want to Learn</button>
          <p>
            Sadly, the button above can't help you. Inspecting the source code
            of this document, however, can.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have tried to summarize everything we have learned (and some
            things we haven't) about HTML and CSS best practises into the design
            and documentation of this page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inspect the elements, read the comments, and feel free to re-use
            this code in your future projects. Let me know if you have any
            questions!

          <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile layouts are typically <em>single-column</em>, perfectly
            suited to the block stacking nature of <em>unstyled HTML</em>.
            Mobile-first designs force the developer to emphasize coherent
            structure and markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspect this page in a mobile layout, both with and without page
            style. Then, view the source CSS. What, if anything, does the CSS
            add to the layout of this page?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h2>Responsive</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive web designs have
            <em>well-defined layouts for each device</em> used to browse the
            page. Tablet and Destkop layouts are often composed of many columns
            to take advantage of wider viewport space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use responsive mode in your browser's developer tools to inspect
            this page at a variety of widths. How does the overall layout change
            at each breakpoint? How are the styles of some components changed?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h2>Accessible</h2>
          <p>
            Accessible design ensures that websites are usable by as many people
            as possible.
            <em
              >Page semantics, colour contrast, keyboard interactivity, network
              speed, and device capability</em
            >
            are just some properties that developers should have in mind when
            designing websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the accessibility auditing tool to inspect these properties on
            this page. What has been done well? What has room for improvement?
          </p>

          <p>
            With practise, you will obtain <em>genuine fluency</em> in
            expressing aesthetic and responsive interfaces using the modern
            tools of the trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that when you are developing websites, or any programs,
            <em>you are not the only person who uses them.</em> In fact, if you
            are successful in this field, your code and your projects will be
            used and read many orders of magnitude more times than the amount of
            time you spend creating them.

          <p>
            Importantly, accessibility also means understanding that there are
            many other kinds of users who have accessibility needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of designing for your own use, then patching until you
            achieve semi-functionality for anyone else, a wise developer places
            themselves into the shoes of the person they’re designing for and
            builds something which speaks their design language. For visually
            impaired users, this might mean laying out information in a more
            logical sense than in a spatial sense.
          </p>

          <p>
            For instance, consider someone who cannot afford a computer as nice
            as the one you are using. A website with a huge JavaScript bundle,
            unoptimized images, and always-on network requirements is not
            accessible to users who are on low-bandwidth mobile connections or
            those that have a data cap — you’re essentially charging poorer
            users a tax to use your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Localization is another kind of accessibility, Users in different
            locales speak not only different natural languages, but different
            design languages. Users of right-to-left languages like Arabic don’t
            just reverse their strings but also the entire layout of the page.
            Chinese and Japanese users are more familiar with denser UIs than
            the typical Western user. And subtitles and transcripts are
            important for Deaf users, but also useful for users who are
            consuming your content in a second language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intuitiveness is another important detail. Not everyone understands
            what your icons mean, for a start. They may not have the motor skill
            to hold their mouse over the button and read the tool-tip, either,
            and might not know that they can do that in the first place!
            Reliance on unfamiliar design language in general is a kind of
            inaccessible design. Flashing banner ads are also inaccessible for
            users with ADHD, and if we’re being honest, for everyone else, too.
            Software which is not responsive on many kinds of devices (touch,
            mouse and keyboard, different screen sizes, aspect ratios,
            orientations) is not accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adequate answers to these problems are **relatively easy to achieve
            if we use the tools made available to us well.** We do not have to
            copy the anti-patterns of social-media monsters like Facebook,
            Twitter, Instagram, and the rest. Designs which are deliberately
            addictive are not accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a fool’s errand to aim for perfect accessibility for all
            users, but we need to understand that our design choices are
            excluding people from using our tools. We need to design our
            software with accessibility in mind from the ground up, and with a
            broad understanding of accessibility that acknowledges that simple,
            intuitive software is the foundation of accessibility which works
            for everyone, including you and me — and not retroactively adding
            half-assed tools to fundamentally unusable software. </p>

            <h2>Break it down</h2>
            <p>
              Not unlike lego, HTML structural elements are <em>blocks</em> by
              default. Each element is a unit on its own that, when combined
              with other elements, comprises a greater whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              When designing, ask yourself: what IS each element on my page?
              What are its constraints? How does it relate to the elements
              around it?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card-s">
            <h2>Work your way up</h2>
            <p>
              Not unlike cooking, CSS styles are <em>recipes</em> for combining
              and transforming ingredients into a finished <s>meal</s> website.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <s>cooking</s> adding css, ask yourself: does this style help
              fulfill a requirement of my project? Try to avoid band-aid
              solutions.
            </p>

          <div class="card-s">
            <h2>~*~</h2>
            <p>
              Not unlike any other programming language, it's helpful to debug
              as you develop. Temporary <em>borders</em> around elements in your
              CSS can help visualize how that element is flowing in your
              document.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally: there's no need to be so serious all the time. It's okay
              to make mistakes. The important things it to make stuff so that
              you can learn how it works.

              The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less you go to the
              theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think,
              love, theorise, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save
              &mdash; the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor
              rust will devour &mdash; your capital. The less you are, the less
              you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is
              your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged
              being. Everything taken from you in life and in humanity, is
              replaced for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which
              you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and, drink, go to the
              dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art,
              learning, the treasures of the past, political power &mdash; all
              this it can appropriate for you &mdash; it can buy all this: it is
              true endowment. Yet being all this, it wants to do nothing but
              create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its
              servant, and when I have the master I have the servant and do not
              need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be
              submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to
              want to live, and may only want to live in order to have that.
