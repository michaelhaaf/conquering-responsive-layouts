            But they will be at first. The development of good technique takes
            both knowledge and practise. In this manner, user interface design
            is no different than any other science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have learned some things about them,
            <em>responsive layouts</em> are actually quite pleasant to make
            (and, of course, to use).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, HTML5 and CSS have matured into very capable
            languages for creating and styling web interfaces. You should
            (hopefully) feel at the end of this course the ability to express
            (at least approximately) any web layout you can see or imagine.
          </p>
          <button type="" class="btn">I Want to Learn</button>
          <p>
            Sadly, the button above can't help you. Inspecting the source code
            of this document, hopefully, can.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have tried to summarize everything we have learned (and some
            extra) about HTML and CSS best practises into the design and
            documentation of this page. Inspect the elements, read the comments,
            and feel free to re-use this code in your future projects. Let me
            know if you have any questions!

          <h2>Mobile-first</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile layouts are typically <em>single-column</em>, perfectly
            suited to the block stacking nature of <em>unstyled HTML</em>.
            Mobile-first designs force the developer to emphasize coherent
            structure and markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspect this page in a mobile layout, both with and without page
            style. Then, view the source CSS. What, if anything, does the CSS
            add to the layout of this page?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <h2>Responsive</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive web designs have
            <em>well-defined layouts for each device</em> used to browse the
            page. Tablet and Destkop layouts are often composed of many columns
            to take advantage of wider viewport space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use responsive mode in your browser's developer tools to inspect
            this page at a variety of widths. How does the overall layout change
            at each breakpoint? How are the styles of some components changed?
          </p>

        <div class="">
          <h2>Accessible</h2>
          <p>
            Good web design is synonymous with accessible web design. The point
            of a webpage is to share content; inaccessible content cannot be
            shared. Take care to ensure <em>keyboard</em>, <em>color</em>, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the accessibility auditing tool to inspect these properties on
            this page. What has been done well? What has room for improvement?

          <h1>It really doesn't have to be so hard</h1>
          <p>
            With practise, you will obtain <em>genuine fluency</em> in
            expressing aesthetic and responsive interfaces using the modern
            tools of the trade.

            <h2>Break it down</h2>
            <p>
              Not unlike lego, HTML structural elements are <em>blocks</em> by
              default. Each element is a unit on its own that, when combined
              with other elements, comprises a greater whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              When designing, ask yourself: what IS each element on my page?
              What are its constraints? How does it relate to the elements
              around it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Also: there's no need to be so serious all the time. It's okay to
              make mistakes. The important things it to make stuff so that you
              can learn how it works.

            <h2>Work your way up</h2>
            <p>
              Not unlike cooking, CSS styles are <em>recipes</em> for combining
              and transforming ingredients into a finished <s>meal</s> website.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <s>cooking</s> adding css, ask yourself: Placing temporary
              <em>borders</em> around elements in your CSS both a great
              debugging tool (to see how an element is flowing in your document)
              as well as great practise (at refining your choice of CSS
              selectors).

              The less you eat, drink and buy books; the less you go to the
              theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think,
              love, theorise, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save
              &mdash; the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor
              rust will devour &mdash; your capital. The less you are, the less
              you express your own life, the more you have, i.e., the greater is
              your alienated life, the greater is the store of your estranged
              being. Everything taken from you in life and in humanity, is
              replaced for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which
              you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and, drink, go to the
              dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art,
              learning, the treasures of the past, political power &mdash; all
              this it can appropriate for you &mdash; it can buy all this: it is
              true endowment. Yet being all this, it wants to do nothing but
              create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its
              servant, and when I have the master I have the servant and do not
              need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be
              submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to
              want to live, and may only want to live in order to have that.
